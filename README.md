Project Description:  Our project focuses on developing an autonomous drone system capable of flying to a designated starting point, detecting objects, and returning to its origin. The drone navigates to the specified location using predefined coordinates or real-time inputs. Once it arrives, the drone employs an object detection algorithm to identify a specific target â€” in our case, a chair. Upon detecting the chair, the drone hovers over the point, lands, and then initiates its return flight to the starting point. This system showcases autonomous navigation, real-time decision-making, object detection, and safe landing capabilities.
